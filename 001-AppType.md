Decision: Web

Rationale: Needs to be able to access websites to reliably get the locations of restaurants closest to the user and the menu's from them. There also needs to be a way to send back orders to the restaurants and that will require a constant connection to the web. 

Status: Proposed

Consequences: Wonâ€™t be able to use it without an internet connection, there needs to be a consideration about how much data the app uses so that it doesn't use all of the users mobile data.
