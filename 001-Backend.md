Decision: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some kind of database, GPS

Rationale: HTML to structure the page and its content, CSS the layout and structure of the web page. The database stores manages and displays order history. GPS to know where the end-user is so that the app can display the nearby restaurants and, later on, where the delivery person is located and how far until the user gets their delivery

Status: Proposed

Consequences: The website page will not look organized clean or user-friendly without the HTML and CSS. The end-user will be unable to access its old orders and have a faster way to just re-order food. Will not be able to know how long until their food takes/arrives
