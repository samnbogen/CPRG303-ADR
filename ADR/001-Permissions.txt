Decision: Location, Payment

Rationale: The app would need to take the userâ€™s location from the GPS to be able to recommend restaurants in the vicinity. It would also need a way to store payment information to allow the user a faster way to make orders. 

Status: Proposed

Consequences: If the user decides not to give those permissions it will slow down the use of the app and give the user a worse experience.
