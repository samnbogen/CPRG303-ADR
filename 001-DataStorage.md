Decision: There needs to be a way to store the user's preferences and order history

Rationale: The app needs to have a way to store what the user has previously ordered so the user can go back and offer to leave a review for the restaurant. It also would allow the user to reorder something if they enjoyed it. 

Status: Proposed

Consequences: The users preferences will need to be kept track of in a database, so that needs to be secure.
