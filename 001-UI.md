Decision: notification, payment method, real-time updates

Rationale: Notification to keep the end-user informed on orders, delivery, and promotions. Payment, so that when the user wants to get it delivered they can pay on the website, they just need to enter their card information and a save payment information button in case they donâ€™t want to re-enter their information each time. Real-time updates the user can see how long it takes until their food arrives, where the drive is located, and if the food was canceled.

Status: Proposed

Consequences: The user will not be able to pay for their food, know when and where their food is coming from, and how long until it arrives
